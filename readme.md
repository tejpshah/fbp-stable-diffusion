This project provided me practical exposure to implementing state of the art pre-trained models into practical application.
In the last several months, there is a surge in popularity surrounding Generative AI with the rise of notable image generation
models such as DALLE-2, Imagen, and more. Stable Diffusion is an open-source version of image generation which has so far 
achieved impressive results. 

In this project, you take as input text prompts in `prompts.txt` which yields the following outputs:
(1) 2 image generations; (2) 2 variations of the images from (1); (3) video generation of diffusion process for all images.
